# Acceptance — Task 4.1.1: Global Error Handler

## Purpose
Comprehensive error management

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Error boundary implementation
- [x] Logging service
- [x] User-friendly messages
- [x] Recovery options
- [x] Support contact
- [x] Error tracking

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 4.1.1 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test POST /api/errors/report endpoint for client-side error reporting with automatic categorization
  2. Test GET /api/errors/stats endpoint for error analytics with authentication
  3. Test GET /api/errors/recent endpoint for recent error listing with filtering
  4. Test POST /api/errors/:errorId/resolve endpoint for error resolution tracking
  5. Test React ErrorBoundary component with graceful fallback and recovery options
  6. Test ErrorFallback component with user-friendly messaging and recovery suggestions
  7. Test logging service with Winston integration and error categorization
  8. Test error middleware with context generation and user-friendly responses
  9. Test client-side error reporting with network resilience and offline storage
  10. Test error tracking with occurrence counting and resolution management
  11. Test useErrorHandler hook with error reporting and statistics management
  12. Verify build process and TypeScript compilation success
