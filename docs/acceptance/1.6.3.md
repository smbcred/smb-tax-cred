# Acceptance — Task 1.6.3: Protected Route Implementation

## Purpose
Secure dashboard and user areas

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Route authentication middleware
- [x] Token verification
- [x] Automatic redirect to login
- [x] Session timeout handling
- [x] Role-based access (future)

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: Manual QA testing of protected routes, authentication, and token verification.
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Professional loading states and clear authentication flow.
- [x] **Security**: JWT tokens secured; automatic token cleanup on expiration.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: Efficient authentication checks; minimal loading states.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Proper loading indicators and focus management.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Authentication events logged via Express middleware.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 1.6.3 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test protected route access without authentication (should redirect to login)
  2. Test login functionality and verify token storage
  3. Test protected route access with valid authentication
  4. Test automatic redirect back to originally requested protected route after login
  5. Test protected API endpoint with and without valid tokens
  6. Test session timeout handling and token expiration
  7. Verify loading states during authentication checks
- Results:
  ✅ Protected routes properly restrict access to authenticated users only
  ✅ Automatic redirect to login page when accessing protected routes without authentication  
  ✅ Successful login redirects back to originally requested protected route
  ✅ Token verification works correctly for API endpoint protection (returns 401 without token)
  ✅ Loading states display properly during authentication checks with professional UI
  ✅ Session timeout monitoring and token expiration handling functional
  ✅ ProtectedRoute component successfully wraps and secures dashboard and checkout pages
  ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with proper type safety for all auth components
