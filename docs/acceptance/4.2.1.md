# Acceptance — Task 4.2.1: Frontend Performance

## Purpose
Optimize load times

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Code splitting
- [x] Lazy loading
- [x] Image optimization
- [x] Caching strategy
- [x] Bundle optimization
- [x] CDN implementation

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 4.2.1 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Verify lazy loading components load on scroll/interaction
  2. Check code splitting reduces initial bundle size
  3. Test image optimization with responsive loading
  4. Validate caching improves subsequent page loads
  5. Confirm CDN resources load efficiently
  6. Monitor performance metrics in console
- Results:
  ✅ All route components now use React.lazy() for code splitting
  ✅ Intersection Observer lazy loading implemented with useLazyLoad hook
  ✅ OptimizedImage component handles responsive images and caching
  ✅ Multi-level caching strategy with memory, IndexedDB, and service worker
  ✅ Performance monitoring shows LCP, bundle size tracking working
  ✅ CDN utilities and resource optimization implemented

## Verification Commands
```bash
npm --prefix client run typecheck && npm --prefix client run lint
npm --prefix server run typecheck && npm --prefix server run lint
npm --prefix client run build
npm --prefix server run test
```
