# Acceptance — Task 4.2.2: Backend Optimization

## Purpose
Improve response times

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Database indexing
- [x] Query optimization
- [x] Caching layer
- [x] Connection pooling
- [x] Rate limiting
- [x] Load balancing prep

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 4.2.2 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test API endpoints with rate limiting applied
  2. Verify caching improves response times on repeated requests
  3. Check database query performance with indexes
  4. Confirm connection pool handles concurrent requests efficiently
  5. Monitor health endpoint shows performance metrics
  6. Test rate limiting blocks excessive requests
- Results:
  ✅ In-memory caching system with TTL and LRU eviction implemented
  ✅ Comprehensive rate limiting with sliding window algorithm
  ✅ Query optimization services with performance monitoring
  ✅ Enhanced connection pool with health monitoring and alerts
  ✅ Database indexes already optimized in schema
  ✅ Load balancing prep with connection pooling and monitoring

## Verification Commands
```bash
npm --prefix client run typecheck && npm --prefix client run lint
npm --prefix server run typecheck && npm --prefix server run lint
npm --prefix client run build
npm --prefix server run test
```
