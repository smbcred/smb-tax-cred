# S3 Storage Service Integration - Task 3.3.1 COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive AWS S3 storage service with the following components:

### Core Service (server/services/storage/s3.ts)
- **S3StorageService class**: Full-featured service with upload, URL generation, and key management
- **Security**: AES256 encryption, private cache control headers, and proper credential handling
- **Key Structure**: `customers/{customerId}/{taxYear}/{docType}-{timestamp}.pdf`
- **Factory Function**: Environment-based service creation with validation

### Testing Infrastructure (server/tests/s3.test.ts)
- **Unit Tests**: 13 comprehensive test cases covering all service methods
- **Mocking**: AWS SDK client mocking with aws-sdk-client-mock library
- **Coverage**: Happy path, error handling, parameter validation, and security features
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper type assertions

### Development Tools (server/routes.ts)
- **Smoke Test Endpoint**: POST /api/dev/s3-smoke for development testing
- **PDF Generation**: Creates valid minimal PDF buffer for upload testing
- **Presigned URLs**: 5-minute expiry URLs for download verification
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with timestamps

## Technical Features Implemented
✅ **Bucket Configuration**: Proper bucket/key structure with metadata
✅ **Upload Functionality**: Buffer upload with AES256 encryption
✅ **Folder Organization**: Customer/year/type hierarchical structure
✅ **Access Control**: Private cache control and secure transmission
✅ **URL Generation**: Presigned URLs with configurable expiration
✅ **Expiration Settings**: Default 1-hour, configurable timeout

## Security & Compliance
- ServerSideEncryption: 'AES256' for all uploads
- CacheControl: 'private, max-age=0' prevents caching
- Credentials: Environment variable configuration with validation
- Metadata: Upload timestamps and context tracking

## Testing Verification
- Build Status: ✅ Application builds successfully with vite build
- Unit Tests: ✅ Comprehensive test suite with mocking
- Type Safety: ✅ Full TypeScript compliance in service layer
- Integration: ✅ Dev smoke test endpoint for manual verification

## Environment Requirements
The service requires the following environment variables:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  
- AWS_REGION (defaults to 'us-east-1')
- AWS_S3_BUCKET (defaults to 'smbtaxcredits-documents')

## Usage Example
```typescript
const s3Service = createS3Service();
const key = s3Service.docKey({ customerId: 'user123', taxYear: 2024, docType: 'form6765' });
await s3Service.uploadPdf({ buffer: pdfBuffer, key, metadata: { source: 'intake-form' } });
const url = await s3Service.getPdfUrl(key, 1800); // 30-minute URL
```

## Next Steps
The S3 service is ready for integration with:
- Document generation workflows (Task 3.2.2 Documint)
- Email delivery systems (Task 3.2.3 SendGrid)  
- User intake form processing
- Payment completion workflows

**Status: COMPLETE ✅**
