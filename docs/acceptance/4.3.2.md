# Acceptance — Task 4.3.2: Data Protection

## Purpose
Secure sensitive data

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Encryption at rest
- [x] Secure transmission
- [x] PII handling
- [x] Access logging
- [x] Compliance checks
- [x] Backup strategy

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 4.3.2 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test data encryption and decryption utilities
  2. Verify access logging captures data access events
  3. Check PII detection and classification mechanisms
  4. Validate compliance audit scoring and reporting
  5. Test backup creation and retention policies
  6. Verify secure transmission headers and protocols
- Results:
  ✅ Comprehensive encryption framework with AES-256-CBC encryption at rest
  ✅ Secure transmission enforced with HTTPS redirect and security headers
  ✅ PII detection automatically classifies sensitive data categories
  ✅ Access logging captures all data operations with audit trail
  ✅ Compliance service provides automated GDPR/CCPA/PCI DSS auditing
  ✅ Backup service with automated scheduling, compression, and retention policies

## Verification Commands
```bash
npm --prefix client run typecheck && npm --prefix client run lint
npm --prefix server run typecheck && npm --prefix server run lint
npm --prefix client run build
npm --prefix server run test
```
