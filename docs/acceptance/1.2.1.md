## Purpose
Build the main marketing page structure

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Hero section with headline and CTA
- [x] Trust signals section (IRS badges, security icons)
- [x] Benefits/features grid
- [x] How it works (3-step process)
- [x] Pricing preview
- [x] Footer with legal links

## Functional Checks
- [ ] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [ ] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [ ] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [ ] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [ ] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [ ] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [ ] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [ ] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.
