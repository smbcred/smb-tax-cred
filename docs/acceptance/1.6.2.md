# Acceptance — Task 1.6.2: Create Login/Register Pages

## Purpose
Build authentication UI

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Login form with validation
- [x] Password reset flow
- [x] Registration via Stripe webhook
- [x] Remember me functionality
- [x] Error messaging
- [x] Redirect logic

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: Manual QA testing of login/register flows, authentication, and error handling.
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Professional design with clear CTAs and mobile-friendly responsive design.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; JWT tokens secured; rate-limit endpoints active.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: Efficient form validation; optimized authentication flow with JWT tokens.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Proper form labels, focus management, password visibility toggle, AA contrast ratios.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Authentication events logged via Express middleware.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 1.6.2 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Navigate to /login to test login page rendering and form validation
  2. Test login form with valid credentials and verify JWT token storage
  3. Test login form with invalid credentials and verify error messaging
  4. Test password reset flow toggle and email input validation
  5. Navigate to /register to test registration page explaining Stripe workflow
  6. Test authentication state management and logout functionality
  7. Verify route protection and redirect logic after login
  8. Test rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Results:
  ✅ Login page renders with professional design and proper form fields
  ✅ Form validation works with real-time error feedback and Zod schema validation
  ✅ Login with valid credentials stores JWT token and redirects to dashboard
  ✅ Login with invalid credentials shows appropriate error toast messages
  ✅ Password reset flow toggles properly with email validation
  ✅ Register page clearly explains Stripe-based registration workflow
  ✅ Authentication state updates correctly throughout the application
  ✅ Logout functionality clears tokens and redirects to home page
  ✅ Route protection works properly with authenticated/unauthenticated states
  ✅ Rate limiting blocks excessive authentication attempts as configured
  ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with proper type safety for all auth components
