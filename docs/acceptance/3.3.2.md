# Acceptance — Task 3.3.2: Download System

## Purpose
User document access

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Secure URL generation
- [x] Time-limited access
- [x] Download tracking
- [x] Zip functionality
- [x] Mobile compatibility
- [x] Bandwidth optimization

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 3.3.2 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test POST /api/downloads/create endpoint for secure download creation with authentication and validation
  2. Test GET /api/downloads/secure/:token endpoint for secure file download with client tracking
  3. Test GET /api/downloads/status/:trackingId endpoint for download status monitoring with ownership verification
  4. Test GET /api/downloads/stats endpoint for download analytics with user activity insights
  5. Test DELETE /api/downloads/:token endpoint for download token deletion with access control
  6. Test POST /api/downloads/optimize endpoint for bandwidth optimization with compression analysis
  7. Test secure URL generation with cryptographically secure tokens and proper expiration
  8. Test time-limited access with configurable expiration and automatic cleanup
  9. Test download tracking with comprehensive analytics and progress monitoring
  10. Test ZIP functionality with intelligent organization and compression control
  11. Test mobile compatibility with responsive design and touch interactions
  12. Test bandwidth optimization with compression analysis and transfer recommendations
  13. Test useDownloadSystem React hook with download management and analytics
  14. Test DownloadManager component with file selection and statistics display
