# Acceptance — Task 1.7.2: Progress Tracking Component

## Purpose
Show intake form completion

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Visual progress bar
- [x] Section completion indicators
- [x] Time estimates
- [x] Next action prompts
- [x] Percentage complete calculation
- [x] Save indicator

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Progress calculations and data display properly validated.
- [x] **Tested**: Manual QA testing of all progress tracking features and responsive behavior.
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Professional design with clear CTAs and mobile-friendly responsive layout.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; component uses proper authentication context.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: Efficient rendering with smooth animations and optimized calculations.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and AA contrast ratios.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Component interactions logged for user behavior tracking.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 1.7.2 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Navigate to dashboard to verify progress tracker component is rendered
  2. Test visual progress bar shows correct 38.9% completion with animation
  3. Verify section completion indicators display proper status badges
  4. Check time estimates calculate correctly based on completion rates
  5. Test next action prompts show appropriate CTAs based on section status
  6. Validate percentage complete calculation accuracy (14/36 fields)
  7. Verify save indicator displays properly with timestamps
  8. Test responsive design across different screen sizes
  9. Verify component integration with dashboard layout
- Results:
  ✅ Progress tracker component renders successfully on dashboard
  ✅ Visual progress bar displays animated completion at 38.9% with smooth transitions
  ✅ Section completion indicators show correct status badges (completed, in_progress, not_started)
  ✅ Time estimates calculate properly based on field completion rates (5-15 min per section)
  ✅ Next action prompts display appropriate CTAs for current section status
  ✅ Percentage complete calculation works accurately (14 completed / 36 total = 38.9%)
  ✅ Save indicator shows timestamp and saving status with proper visual feedback
  ✅ Responsive design functions correctly across mobile and desktop screen sizes
  ✅ Component integrates seamlessly with existing dashboard layout
  ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with comprehensive type safety
