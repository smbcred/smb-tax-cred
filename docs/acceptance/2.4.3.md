# Acceptance — Task 2.4.3: Status Polling Service

## Purpose
Monitor generation progress

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Polling interval setup
- [x] Status check endpoint
- [x] Progress updates
- [x] Completion detection
- [x] Error handling
- [x] User notifications

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 2.4.3 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test POST /api/workflows/polling/start/:triggerId endpoint with authentication
  2. Test configurable polling intervals with 10-second default and automatic cleanup
  3. Test GET /api/workflows/status/:triggerId for real-time status monitoring
  4. Test progress updates with percentage tracking and estimated completion times
  5. Test completion detection with automatic polling termination
  6. Test error handling with network failures and timeout scenarios
  7. Test user notifications through toast messages and UI status updates
  8. Test ProgressMonitor React component with real-time monitoring controls
  9. Test useStatusPolling hook with automatic lifecycle management
- Results:
  ✅ POST /api/workflows/polling/start/:triggerId starts polling with proper authentication
  ✅ Configurable polling intervals use 10-second default with exponential backoff retry
  ✅ GET /api/workflows/status/:triggerId provides real-time workflow status and trigger info
  ✅ Progress updates show percentage completion with estimated times through mock simulation
  ✅ Completion detection automatically stops polling on completed/failed/timeout states
  ✅ Error handling includes network failure recovery and timeout protection with cleanup
  ✅ User notifications provide real-time feedback through toast messages and status badges
  ✅ ProgressMonitor component offers comprehensive monitoring with start/stop controls
  ✅ useStatusPolling hook manages polling lifecycle with automatic cleanup on unmount
