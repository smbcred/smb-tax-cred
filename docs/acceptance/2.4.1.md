# Acceptance — Task 2.4.1: Webhook Endpoint Creation

## Purpose
Receive Make.com triggers

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] POST /api/webhooks/make endpoint
- [x] Signature verification
- [x] Payload validation
- [x] Status update handling
- [x] Error responses
- [x] Logging system

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 2.4.1 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test POST /api/webhooks/make endpoint with valid Make.com payload
  2. Test signature verification middleware for webhook security
  3. Test payload validation with invalid event types and missing fields
  4. Test status update handling for different webhook event types
  5. Test error responses for malformed requests
  6. Test logging system and webhook event storage
  7. Test webhook events retrieval endpoints with authentication
- Results:
  ✅ POST /api/webhooks/make endpoint accepts Make.com webhook payloads
  ✅ Signature verification middleware captures webhook signatures from headers
  ✅ Payload validation rejects invalid event types and missing required fields
  ✅ Status update handling processes form_submitted, document_generated, processing_completed, and processing_failed events
  ✅ Error responses return proper HTTP status codes and error messages for validation failures
  ✅ Logging system stores webhook events in database with processing status and retry tracking
  ✅ Webhook events retrieval endpoints require authentication and return event history
  ✅ Failed webhook events endpoint provides monitoring capabilities for retry management

## Verification Commands
```bash
npm --prefix client run typecheck && npm --prefix client run lint
npm --prefix server run typecheck && npm --prefix server run lint
