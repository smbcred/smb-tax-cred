# 6.1.1 DB prep: admin flag, audit & webhook logs

## Definition of Done
[x] users.is_admin boolean (default false)  
[x] audit_logs table (admin_user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, before, after, created_at)  
[x] webhook_logs table (source, status, event, payload_sha256, created_at)  
[x] Drizzle schema + migration committed  
[ ] .env.example updated if needed

## Functional Checks
[x] Migration up/down runs locally  
[x] Can insert a webhook_logs row from code path (mock)  
[x] Query audit_logs by entity works

## Non-Functional
[ ] PII safe (no secrets in logs)  
[ ] Indices on created_at, entity_id (if large tables)
