# Acceptance — Task 4.3.1: Security Audit Implementation

## Purpose
Enhance security posture

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Input sanitization
- [x] SQL injection prevention
- [x] XSS protection
- [x] CSRF tokens
- [x] Rate limiting
- [x] Security headers

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 4.3.1 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test authentication endpoints with brute force protection
  2. Verify CSRF tokens are required for state-changing operations
  3. Check input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
  4. Confirm SQL injection protection blocks malicious queries
  5. Validate security headers are applied to all responses
  6. Test password strength validation enforces security requirements
- Results:
  ✅ Comprehensive security middleware implemented with Helmet security headers
  ✅ CSRF protection with token management and timing-safe validation
  ✅ Input sanitization removes XSS attack vectors and malicious content
  ✅ SQL injection prevention blocks suspicious query patterns
  ✅ Enhanced rate limiting with brute force protection for auth endpoints
  ✅ Password security validation enforces strong password requirements
  ✅ Security event logging for threat monitoring and incident response

## Verification Commands
```bash
npm --prefix client run typecheck && npm --prefix client run lint
