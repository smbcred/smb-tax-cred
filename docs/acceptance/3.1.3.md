## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test POST /api/compliance/memo/generate endpoint for comprehensive memo generation
  2. Test POST /api/compliance/memo/preview endpoint for compliance overview and scoring
  3. Test memo structure template with professional legal memorandum formatting
  4. Test risk assessment logic with multi-factor analysis and weighted scoring
  5. Test four-part test mapping with detailed IRC Section 41 requirement analysis
  6. Test QRE justification with 65% contractor limitation and expense analysis
  7. Test IRS alignment with Treasury Regulation references and compliance positioning
  8. Test useComplianceMemo React hook with formatting utilities and sample data
