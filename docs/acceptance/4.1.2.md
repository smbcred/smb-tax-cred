# Acceptance — Task 4.1.2: Integration Failure Recovery

## Purpose
Handle third-party failures

## Definition of Done (check all)
- [x] Retry mechanisms
- [x] Fallback options
- [x] Queue management
- [x] Manual intervention
- [x] Status reporting
- [x] Notification system

## Functional Checks
- [x] **Exists**: Files/components/routes created.
- [x] **Wired**: UI → API → DB flow demonstrated.
- [x] **Validated**: Server-side input validation returns clear errors.
- [x] **Tested**: At least one unit or integration test (happy + error).
- [x] **UX/Copy**: Labels/CTAs match guide; mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Security**: No secrets committed; rate-limit public endpoints.

## Non-Functional (as applicable)
- [x] **Performance**: No obvious jank; sensible batching/debouncing.
- [x] **Accessibility**: Labels/focus/roles; AA contrast.
- [x] **Telemetry**: Key events logged if defined.

## Artifacts to Update
- [x] `/docs/TASKS_for_v2.md` — mark 4.1.2 complete.
- [x] `/docs/PROGRESS.md` — what changed and why (file links).
- [x] `/docs/BLOCKERS.md` — add/remove blockers.

## Manual QA Notes
- Steps:
  1. Test RetryService with exponential backoff and abort capabilities
  2. Test QueueService with priority processing and job lifecycle management
  3. Test IntegrationRecoveryService with health monitoring and recovery orchestration
  4. Test IntegrationMiddleware with automatic failure reporting and request queueing
  5. Test GET /api/integrations/health endpoint for comprehensive status monitoring
  6. Test GET /api/integrations/:integration/health endpoint for individual integration tracking
  7. Test POST /api/integrations/:integration/recover endpoint for recovery triggering
  8. Test POST /api/integrations/:integration/maintenance endpoint for maintenance mode
  9. Test GET /api/integrations/queue/stats endpoint for queue analytics
  10. Test GET /api/integrations/interventions/pending endpoint for intervention management
  11. Test POST /api/integrations/interventions/:id/resolve endpoint for resolution tracking
  12. Test React IntegrationStatus component with real-time monitoring and manual intervention
  13. Test useIntegrationStatus hook with comprehensive integration management functionality
  14. Verify build process and TypeScript compilation success
- Results:
  ✅ RetryService provides exponential backoff with configurable strategies, abort capabilities, and comprehensive event tracking
  ✅ QueueService offers priority processing with concurrent execution limits, job lifecycle tracking, and comprehensive analytics
  ✅ IntegrationRecoveryService delivers health monitoring with recovery orchestration, manual intervention coordination, and status tracking
  ✅ IntegrationMiddleware enables automatic integration monitoring with failure reporting and request management
  ✅ GET /api/integrations/health provides comprehensive integration status with real-time monitoring and analytics
  ✅ GET /api/integrations/:integration/health offers individual integration tracking with detailed metrics and error history
  ✅ POST /api/integrations/:integration/recover enables recovery triggering with automatic health verification
  ✅ POST /api/integrations/:integration/maintenance allows maintenance mode activation with reason tracking
  ✅ GET /api/integrations/queue/stats provides queue statistics with throughput metrics and performance analytics
  ✅ GET /api/integrations/interventions/pending delivers pending intervention management with approval workflows
  ✅ POST /api/integrations/interventions/:id/resolve enables intervention resolution with action tracking
  ✅ React IntegrationStatus component offers real-time monitoring with manual intervention and comprehensive queue management
  ✅ useIntegrationStatus hook provides complete integration management with health tracking and intervention resolution
  ✅ Build process succeeds with proper TypeScript integration and comprehensive error handling
