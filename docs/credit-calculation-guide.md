## Current Law Overview

### IRC Section 41 - Research Credit
The federal R&D tax credit is permanent (made so by PATH Act 2015) and provides:

- **Regular Credit**: 20% of QREs exceeding a base amount
- **Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC)**: 14% of QREs exceeding 50% of 3-year average
- **Startup Payroll Tax Credit**: Up to **$500,000** against payroll taxes (doubled from $250,000 by IRA 2022)
- **Full R&D Deduction**: Restored for 2025+ (reversing 2022-2024 amortization)

### Four-Part Test (All Must Be Met)
1. **Technological in Nature**: Relies on hard sciences (engineering, computer science, biological sciences, physical sciences)
2. **Elimination of Uncertainty**: Technical uncertainty about capability, method, or design
3. **Process of Experimentation**: Systematic trial and error, modeling, simulation, or testing
4. **Qualified Purpose**: New or improved functionality, performance, reliability, or quality

## Calculation Methods

### Method 1: Regular Research Credit (RRC)
```typescript
// Regular Credit: 20% of excess over base
// Most SMBs get ~10% effective rate due to 50% minimum base
const calculateRegularCredit = (currentQRE: number, historicalData: any) => {
  // For startups: 3% fixed base for first 5 years
  // For others: Complex historical calculation
  const minimumBase = currentQRE * 0.5; // 50% floor
  const computedBase = calculateHistoricalBase(historicalData);
  const effectiveBase = Math.max(computedBase, minimumBase);
  const excess = Math.max(0, currentQRE - effectiveBase);
  return excess * 0.20;
};
```

### Method 2: Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC) - Recommended for SMBs
```typescript
// ASC: More straightforward calculation
const calculateASC = (currentQRE: number, priorThreeYears: number[]) => {
  // First-time filers (no prior QREs)
  if (!priorThreeYears.length || priorThreeYears.every(y => y === 0)) {
    return currentQRE * 0.06; // 6% for first-timers
  }
  
  // Repeat filers
  const avgPrior = priorThreeYears.reduce((a,b) => a+b, 0) / priorThreeYears.length;
  const base = avgPrior * 0.5; // 50% of average
  const excess = Math.max(0, currentQRE - base);
  return excess * 0.14; // 14% of excess
};
```

## Qualified Small Business (QSB) Benefits

### Payroll Tax Offset - Major Startup Benefit! 🚀

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Gross receipts < $5 million in credit year
- No gross receipts before 5 tax years ago  
- Not a tax-exempt organization
- Must elect on timely filed original return (no amendments!)

**Benefits (Enhanced by IRA 2022):**
- Apply up to **$500,000** of R&D credits against payroll taxes annually (was $250k pre-2023)
- First $250k offsets Social Security tax (6.2% employer portion)
- Next $250k offsets Medicare tax (1.45% employer portion)
- Provides immediate cash flow benefit (quarterly via Form 941)
- Available for up to 5 tax years total (lifetime limit)

**How It Works:**
1. Calculate R&D credit on Form 6765
2. Make Section D election for payroll tax offset
3. File Form 8974 with quarterly Form 941
4. Reduce payroll tax deposits immediately

**Example:**
```
AI Startup with $400,000 R&D credit, no income tax liability:
- Elects $400,000 payroll tax offset
- Quarterly payroll tax: $30,000
- Pays $0 payroll tax for 3+ quarters
- Saves $400,000 in cash within 12-15 months
```

## Recent Law Changes (2022-2025)

### 2015: PATH Act
- Made R&D credit permanent (was temporary for 30+ years)
- Introduced $250,000 payroll tax offset for startups
- Allowed credit to offset AMT for private companies

### 2017: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)
- Eliminated corporate AMT (expanded credit usability)
- **Enacted Section 174 amortization starting 2022** (see below)

### 2022-2024: Section 174 Amortization Period ⚠️
- R&D expenses must be capitalized and amortized:
  - Domestic R&D: 5 years
  - Foreign R&D: 15 years
- Created cash flow challenges for R&D-heavy businesses
- Still could claim credit, but couldn't fully deduct expenses

### 2022: Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
- **Doubled payroll tax offset cap from $250k to $500k** ✅
- Expanded to allow Medicare tax offset (previously only Social Security)
- Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022

### 2025: "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA) 🎉
- **Restored 100% immediate deduction for domestic R&D** (reversing Section 174)
- Foreign R&D still requires 15-year amortization
- Retroactive relief options for 2022-2024 amortization
- Enhanced Form 6765 with new Section G project documentation

## Section 280C Election

### The Choice: Full Credit vs. Reduced Credit

**Option 1: Full Credit**
- Take 100% of calculated credit
- Must reduce R&D deduction by credit amount
- More complex accounting
- May increase taxable income

**Option 2: Reduced Credit (Recommended for SMBs)**
- Take credit × (1 - 21%) = 79% of full credit
- Keep full R&D deduction
- Simpler accounting
- Often similar net benefit

**Example Comparison:**
```
$100,000 QREs, 14% ASC rate = $14,000 potential credit

Full Credit:
- Credit: $14,000
- Lost deduction: $14,000 × 21% = $2,940 tax increase  
- Net benefit: $11,060

Reduced Credit:
- Credit: $14,000 × 79% = $11,060
- Lost deduction: $0
- Net benefit: $11,060

Result: Same benefit, simpler with reduced credit!
```

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: First-Time Filer (Software Startup)
```
TechStartup Inc - 2025 Tax Year
- 5 engineers × $120,000 salary = $600,000
- 80% time on R&D = $480,000 wage QREs
- $50,000 AWS costs for development
- $30,000 contractor for specialized AI work
- Total QREs: $480,000 + $50,000 + ($30,000 × 65%) = $549,500

ASC Calculation (first-time):
- Credit = $549,500 × 6% = $32,970

QSB Payroll Offset:
- Gross receipts: $1.2M ✓
- First year of revenue ✓  
- Can offset full $32,970 against Q1-Q2 payroll taxes
```

### Example 2: Repeat Filer (E-commerce Company)
```
ShopTech LLC - 2025 Tax Year
Prior 3 years QREs: $200k, $250k, $300k (avg = $250k)
Current year: $400,000 QREs

ASC Calculation:
- Base = $250,000 × 50% = $125,000
- Excess = $400,000 - $125,000 = $275,000
- Credit = $275,000 × 14% = $38,500

Not QSB (>$5M revenue), uses against income tax
```

### Example 3: Maximum Payroll Offset
```
BioAI Corp - 2025 Tax Year  
- 50 researchers × $150,000 = $7,500,000 wages
- $2M in lab supplies and cloud compute
- Total QREs: $9,500,000
- Prior 3-year average: $5,000,000

ASC Calculation:
- Base = $5,000,000 × 50% = $2,500,000
- Excess = $9,500,000 - $2,500,000 = $7,000,000
- Credit = $7,000,000 × 14% = $980,000

QSB Status:
- Revenue: $4.8M ✓
- Age: 3 years ✓
- Elects maximum $500,000 payroll offset
- Remaining $480,000 carries forward
```
