# SMBTaxCredits.com - Business Rules & R&D Qualification Guide

## Core Business Rules

### 1. Platform Scope
- **Federal Credits Only**: No state credit calculations or documentation
- **SMB Focus**: Businesses with <500 employees
- **AI/Automation Focus**: Emphasis on practical AI experimentation, not AI development
- **Self-Serve Model**: Fully automated without consultant intervention

### 2. What Qualifies as R&D

#### The Four-Part Test (IRS Section 41)
All activities must meet ALL four criteria:

1. **Technological in Nature**: Work relies on hard sciences (computer science, engineering)
2. **Elimination of Uncertainty**: Attempting to eliminate technical uncertainty
3. **Process of Experimentation**: Systematic trial and error, modeling, or testing
4. **Business Component**: Developing new or improved functionality, performance, reliability, or quality

#### AI-Specific Qualifying Activities

**✅ QUALIFIES - Test-and-Learn Work:**
- **Prompt Engineering**: Iterating prompts through multiple versions, tracking improvements
- **Custom GPT Development**: Building specialized assistants with retrieval, guardrails
- **Chatbot Tuning**: Testing responses, measuring deflection rates, reducing errors
- **Workflow Automation**: LLM-based routing, classification with iteration
- **Data Processing**: AI-powered cleanup with edge case handling
- **Integration Development**: Connecting AI tools to business systems
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving accuracy, speed, or cost efficiency

**❌ DOES NOT QUALIFY - Routine Work:**
- One-time chatbot setup without customization
- Using AI for routine content generation
- Simple prompt usage without experimentation
- Off-the-shelf tool implementation without modification
- Work without documented testing/iteration

### 3. Documentation Requirements

   - Time spent
   - Dates of work
   - Problems encountered

#### Documentation Quality Standards
- **Contemporaneous**: Created during or shortly after work
- **Specific**: Detailed enough to show experimentation
- **Measurable**: Includes quantifiable improvements
- **Technical**: Shows systematic approach, not random tries

### 4. Expense Qualification (QREs)
