## Documentation Best Practices

### For Each Project, Document:

1. **Initial State**
   - What problem were you solving?
   - How was it done before?
   - What metrics were problematic?

2. **Experimentation Log**
   - What approaches did you test?
   - How many iterations?
   - What failed and why?
   - Decision points and rationale

3. **Technical Details**
   - Prompt versions with dates
   - Configuration changes
   - Integration points
   - Error handling improvements

4. **Results & Metrics**
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Time savings
   - Quality improvements
   - Cost reductions

5. **Lessons Learned**
   - What worked best?
   - What would you do differently?
   - Future improvement ideas

## Red Flags to Avoid

## Success Story Template

When documenting your AI experiments, structure them as:

1. **Challenge**: [Specific business problem]
2. **Hypothesis**: [What you thought might work]
3. **Experiments**: [What you actually tested]
4. **Iterations**: [How you refined it]
5. **Results**: [Measurable improvements]
6. **Next Steps**: [Future enhancements planned]

This structure clearly shows the R&D nature of your work and makes IRS compliance straightforward.
