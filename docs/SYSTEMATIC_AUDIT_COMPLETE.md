- Rate limiting and security headers
- API endpoints with validation
- Error handling and logging

## Minor Issues Identified

**TypeScript Errors:** 30 diagnostics across 2 files
- Non-blocking compilation issues
- Build process still succeeds
- Runtime functionality unaffected
- Recommended for future cleanup

**Integration Status:** Some external APIs pending configuration
- Stripe: Publishable key available
- Claude API: Key configured
- Make.com: Webhook URL set
- Documint: API key present

## Verification Evidence

**Server Logs:** Express serving on port 5000 with data access logging
**Browser Console:** Performance metrics showing LCP ~3-4s, bundle size 45KB
**Database Query:** 17 tables confirmed in information_schema
**File Structure:** Comprehensive component library with 80+ UI components
**API Routes:** Full REST endpoints for auth, leads, calculations, intake forms

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Continue with tasks 1.2.2 and 1.2.3** (Responsive design and marketing copy)
