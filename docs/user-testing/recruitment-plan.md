Subject: Help Improve AI Tax Credit Service - $150 Thank You

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because you're exactly the type of business leader we want to hear from.

We've built a service that helps small businesses document their AI tool usage to claim federal R&D tax credits (worth 10-16% of project costs). Before we fully launch, we'd love your feedback on the user experience.

Would you be interested in a 60-minute feedback session? As a thank you, we'll provide:
- $150 Amazon gift card
- Early access to our service (saving $500+)
- Personalized tax credit estimate for your business

The session would involve:
- Testing our calculator and intake process
- Sharing your thoughts as you navigate
- No preparation needed - just your honest feedback

Are you available for a brief call this week to see if it's a good fit?

Best regards,
[Name]
SMBTaxCredits.com Team

P.S. This is especially valuable if your business uses tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI platforms for operations.
