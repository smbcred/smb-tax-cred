# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is SMBTaxCredits.com?
SMBTaxCredits.com is a documentation service that helps small businesses document their AI experimentation work to claim federal R&D tax credits. We're like having a smart friend who knows taxes and helps you organize your AI-related business activities for potential tax savings.

### How much money can I save?
The R&D tax credit can be worth 6-14% of your qualifying expenses, up to $250,000 per year for small businesses. For example:
- $50,000 in AI-related expenses = $3,000-$7,000 in tax credits
- $100,000 in expenses = $6,000-$14,000 in credits
- $200,000 in expenses = $12,000-$28,000 in credits

### Do I qualify if I just use ChatGPT for my business?
Potentially yes! If you're experimenting with AI tools to improve your business processes, you may qualify. The key is that you're testing and implementing new technologies, not just using them routinely.

**Examples that qualify:**
- Testing different AI tools for customer service
- Experimenting with AI for content creation
- Using AI to analyze business data in new ways
- Implementing AI chatbots or automation

**Examples that don't qualify:**
- Routine use of established tools without experimentation
- Personal use of AI tools
- Pure software development for sale

## Eligibility Questions

### What business types qualify?
Most business types can qualify if they use AI experimentally:
- **Professional Services**: Law firms, accounting, consulting
- **Healthcare**: Medical practices, dental offices, veterinary clinics
- **Retail**: E-commerce, brick-and-mortar stores
- **Manufacturing**: Any size manufacturing operation
- **Technology**: SaaS companies, IT services (for internal AI use)
- **Real Estate**: Agencies, property management
- **Construction**: General contractors, specialty trades

### Do I need to be profitable to claim the credit?
No! The R&D credit can be used against payroll taxes if you don't have income tax liability. This makes it valuable for startups and growing businesses.

### Can I claim credits for previous years?
Yes, you can typically claim R&D credits for the past 3 years if you have qualifying activities and haven't already claimed them.

### What if I'm just a one-person business?
You can still qualify! Solo entrepreneurs and single-member LLCs often have substantial AI-related R&D activities that qualify for credits.
