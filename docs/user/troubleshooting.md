# Troubleshooting Guide

## Calculator Issues

### Calculator won't load or shows errors
**Symptoms**: Blank calculator, "Something went wrong" message, or loading spinner that never stops

**Solutions**:
1. **Refresh the page** - Clear any temporary issues
2. **Clear browser cache** - Hold Ctrl+Shift+R (PC) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. **Try a different browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
4. **Disable ad blockers** - Some blockers interfere with our calculator
5. **Check internet connection** - Ensure stable connection

**Still not working?** Email help@smbtaxcredits.com with your browser and device details.

### Calculator results seem wrong
**Common causes**:
- **Expense amounts too high**: Check if you entered cents (use $50000, not $50000.00)
- **Wrong business type**: Different types have different qualification rules
- **Including non-qualifying expenses**: Only R&D related expenses count

**How to verify**:
1. Double-check all expense entries
2. Review [qualifying activities](./getting-started.md#what-qualifies-as-rd-for-ai-users)
3. Try the calculation manually: expenses × credit rate (6% or 14%)

### Can't capture lead information
**If the lead capture modal won't open**:
1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
2. Check if popup blockers are preventing the modal
3. Try clicking directly on "Get My Results" button

**If form won't submit**:
1. Check that email address is valid format
2. Ensure all required fields are filled
3. Wait 30 seconds and try again

## Account & Authentication Issues

### Can't create account or login
**Registration problems**:
- **Email already exists**: Try logging in instead, or use password reset
- **Password requirements**: Must be at least 8 characters with mix of letters and numbers
- **Email not received**: Check spam folder, wait 5 minutes, or try different email

**Login problems**:
- **Forgot password**: Use "Forgot Password" link on login page
- **Account locked**: Wait 15 minutes and try again
- **Email verification**: Check for verification email in spam folder

### Dashboard won't load
**Symptoms**: Blank dashboard, loading errors, or "unauthorized" messages

**Solutions**:
1. **Logout and login again** - Refresh your session
2. **Clear cookies** - Remove stored authentication data
3. **Check payment status** - Ensure your payment was processed
4. **Try incognito/private browsing** - Eliminates browser-specific issues

## Payment & Checkout Issues

### Checkout page problems
