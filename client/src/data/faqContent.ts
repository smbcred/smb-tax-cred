    question: "I just use ChatGPT for my business. Do I qualify?",
    answer: "If you're experimenting with custom prompts, building GPTs, or figuring out how to use AI for your specific needs, you likely qualify. Basic daily use doesn't qualify, but most businesses do more experimentation than they realize. Our calculator will help you determine exactly what qualifies.",
    category: "eligibility"
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as AI experimentation?",
    answer: "Testing prompts to get better results, building custom GPTs or chatbots, creating AI workflows, automating tasks with AI, integrating AI tools with your systems, and even failed experiments. If you're figuring out how to make AI work for your business, that's experimentation.",
    category: "eligibility"
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be technical or know how to code?",
    answer: "Not at all! R&D credits aren't just for programmers. If you're solving business problems with AI—even without coding—your experimentation qualifies. We built this specifically for non-technical business owners.",
    category: "eligibility"
  },
  {
    question: "Is this legitimate? Can ChatGPT work really qualify?",
    answer: "Yes! The IRS recognizes experimentation and testing as qualifying R&D activities. Prompt engineering, custom GPT development, and AI implementations fall squarely within federal guidelines. We ensure all documentation meets IRS requirements.",
    category: "legitimacy"
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I claim for AI experiments?",
    answer: "Most businesses using AI claim $15,000-$50,000 in credits. The amount depends on time spent experimenting (yours and your team's), contractor costs for AI projects, and AI tool subscriptions used for experimentation. Our calculator gives you an accurate estimate in 2 minutes.",
    category: "value"
  },
  {
    question: "What expenses qualify?",
    answer: "Employee time spent on AI projects (wages), contractors building AI solutions, ChatGPT Plus/Team/Enterprise subscriptions, Claude Pro, other AI tools (Midjourney, Jasper, etc.), cloud costs for AI workloads, and training/courses on AI implementation.",
    category: "expenses"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim past AI work?",
    answer: "Yes! You can claim credits for 2022, 2023, and 2024 AI experiments. Each additional year costs just $297. Many businesses have been using AI for years without realizing it qualifies for credits.",
    category: "process"
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from R&D consultants?",
    answer: "Traditional consultants charge 15-30% of your credit and take months. We charge a flat fee ($500-$1,500) and deliver in 48 hours. Plus, we specialize in AI experimentation, not traditional R&D, so we understand your work better.",
    category: "comparison"
  },
  {
    question: "What will my accountant receive?",
    answer: "A complete package including: IRS Form 6765 data, AI experimentation narratives, technical documentation showing how your work qualifies, expense breakdowns, and filing instructions. Your CPA will know exactly what to do.",
    category: "deliverables"
  },
  {
    question: "Is my business too small for this?",
    answer: "No! Even solo consultants using AI qualify. If you've spent 100+ hours testing and implementing AI solutions, you likely have a meaningful credit. The smallest credits we process are around $5,000—still a 10x ROI on our $500 fee.",
    category: "size"
