    question: "Do I even qualify for the R&D credit?",
    answer: "If you develop software, use AI, create new products, or improve processes with technology, you likely qualify. The key is whether you faced technical uncertainty and went through a process of experimentation. Our calculator helps you determine eligibility in under 2 minutes.",
    category: "eligibility"
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not profitable yet?",
    answer: "Great news! Qualified Small Businesses (QSBs) can claim up to $500K against payroll taxes instead of income taxes. If you have less than $5M in gross receipts and no receipts from more than 5 years ago, you may qualify for this cash-flow friendly option.",
    category: "eligibility"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim credits for past years?",
    answer: "Yes! You can amend returns for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Each additional year is just $297. The IRS follows a 3-year/2-year rule for refunds, so don't wait too long.",
    category: "process"
  },
  {
    question: "Do you file my taxes?",
    answer: "No, we prepare all the documentation and forms your CPA needs to file. Think of us as R&D credit specialists who handle the complex documentation while your CPA handles the actual filing. It's a clean handoff.",
    category: "process"
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from hiring a consultant?",
    answer: "Traditional consultants charge 20-40% of your credit and take months. We charge a flat fee (typically 2-5% of your credit) and deliver in days. You get the same IRS-compliant documentation without the sales pressure or huge fees.",
    category: "comparison"
  },
  {
    question: "What documentation will I receive?",
    answer: "You'll get everything needed for filing: Form 6765 data, technical narratives explaining how your work meets the four-part test, Section G summaries, QRE calculations, a compliance memo, recordkeeping checklist, and step-by-step filing instructions for your CPA.",
    category: "deliverables"
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the whole process take?",
    answer: "Most users complete the intake in 15-20 minutes. We then generate your documentation package within 1-3 business days. Compare that to traditional consultants who take 2-3 months!",
    category: "timeline"
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We use bank-level encryption, collect only the minimum data needed, and automatically delete everything after 90 days. We're SOC 2 Type II compliant and never share your data.",
    category: "security"
  },
  {
    question: "What if my credit estimate changes?",
    answer: "If your final credit is lower than estimated, we automatically refund the difference in pricing tiers. If it's higher, we may charge up to $250 more (pre-authorized). We believe in fair, transparent pricing.",
    category: "pricing"
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle state R&D credits?",
    answer: "Our base package focuses on federal credits, which are available to all qualifying businesses. State credits vary significantly by state. We can provide state-specific guidance as an add-on service.",
