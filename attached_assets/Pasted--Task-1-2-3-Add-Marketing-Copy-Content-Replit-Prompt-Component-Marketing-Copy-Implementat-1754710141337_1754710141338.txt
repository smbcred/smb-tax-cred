# Task 1.2.3: Add Marketing Copy & Content - Replit Prompt

## Component: Marketing Copy Implementation
**Reference**: Updated Copywriting & Positioning Guide.md, Updated Branding + positioning system for SMBTaxCredits.md, Updated SMBTaxCredits Competitive Positioning.md, Market Positioning Brief
**AI-Using Business Focus**: Copy optimized for businesses experimenting with ChatGPT, Claude, custom GPTs, and AI automation

### Overview
Populate the SMBTaxCredits.com landing page with conversion-optimized copy that speaks to businesses using AI tools. All copy uses plain English, avoids technical jargon, and emphasizes that no coding is required to qualify for credits.

### Technical Requirements
- **Dependencies**: React components already created in Task 1.2.1
- **Content Management**: Static content for MVP, prepare structure for future CMS
- **SEO**: Proper meta tags optimized for AI experimentation keywords
- **A/B Testing**: Structure copy to easily swap variants

### Implementation Prompt

"Add all marketing copy and content to the SMBTaxCredits.com landing page, focusing on businesses using AI tools (not building AI). Use simple, accessible language throughout. Emphasize that experimenting with ChatGPT, custom GPTs, and AI automation qualifies for federal tax credits.

**1. Update Meta Tags and SEO (components/seo/MetaTags.tsx):**

**7. FAQ Content (data/faqContent.ts):**
```typescript
/**
 * @description FAQs focused on AI experimentation
 * TONE: Reassuring and educational
 */

export const faqContent = [
  {
    question: "I just use ChatGPT for my business. Do I qualify?",
    answer: "If you're experimenting with custom prompts, building GPTs, or figuring out how to use AI for your specific needs, you likely qualify. Basic daily use doesn't qualify, but most businesses do more experimentation than they realize. Our calculator will help you determine exactly what qualifies.",
    category: "eligibility"
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as AI experimentation?",
    answer: "Testing prompts to get better results, building custom GPTs or chatbots, creating AI workflows, automating tasks with AI, integrating AI tools with your systems, and even failed experiments. If you're figuring out how to make AI work for your business, that's experimentation.",
    category: "eligibility"
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be technical or know how to code?",
    answer: "Not at all! R&D credits aren't just for programmers. If you're solving business problems with AI—even without coding—your experimentation qualifies. We built this specifically for non-technical business owners.",
    category: "eligibility"
  },
  {
    question: "Is this legitimate? Can ChatGPT work really qualify?",
    answer: "Yes! The IRS recognizes experimentation and testing as qualifying R&D activities. Prompt engineering, custom GPT development, and AI implementations fall squarely within federal guidelines. We ensure all documentation meets IRS requirements.",
    category: "legitimacy"
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I claim for AI experiments?",
    answer: "Most businesses using AI claim $15,000-$50,000 in credits. The amount depends on time spent experimenting (yours and your team's), contractor costs for AI projects, and AI tool subscriptions used for experimentation. Our calculator gives you an accurate estimate in 2 minutes.",
    category: "value"
  },
  {
    question: "What expenses qualify?",
    answer: "Your time testing AI solutions (typically $100-200/hour), employee time on AI projects, contractors helping with AI implementations, AI tool subscriptions (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, etc.), and related technology costs. Even failed experiments count!",
    category: "expenses"
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to save all my ChatGPT conversations?",
    answer: "No, but saving key examples helps. Focus on conversations where you tested different approaches, solved specific problems, or built something new. We'll help you identify what documentation you need.",
    category: "documentation"
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from my regular business expenses?",
    answer: "Business expenses are tax deductions that reduce your taxable income. R&D credits directly reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar. On $30,000 of AI experimentation, a deduction might save you $6,000-9,000, but a credit saves you the full $3,000-4,500.",
    category: "tax_benefit"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim past years of AI experiments?",
    answer: "Yes! You can claim credits for AI experiments from 2022, 2023, and 2024. Each additional year is just $297. Don't leave money on the table—many businesses have been experimenting with AI for years without realizing it qualifies.",
    category: "past_years"
  },
  {
    question: "What will my CPA think?",
    answer: "CPAs love our documentation because it's thorough, organized, and IRS-compliant. We handle the specialized R&D credit documentation while they handle the filing. It's a clean handoff that makes their job easier.",
