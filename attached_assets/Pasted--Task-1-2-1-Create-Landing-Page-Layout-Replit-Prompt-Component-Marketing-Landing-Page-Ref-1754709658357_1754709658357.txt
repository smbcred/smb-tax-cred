2. "What counts as AI experimentation?"
   - "Testing prompts, building custom GPTs, creating chatbots, automating with AI, integrating AI tools, and even failed experiments all count. If you're figuring out how to make AI work for your business, that's R&D."

3. "Do I need to be technical?"
   - "Not at all! R&D credits aren't just for programmers. If you're solving business problems with AI—even without coding—your experimentation qualifies."

4. "Is this legitimate?"
   - "Yes! The IRS recognizes experimentation and testing as R&D. Prompt engineering and custom AI implementations qualify under federal guidelines."

5. "How much can I claim?"
   - "Most businesses claim $15,000-50,000 in credits. The amount depends on time spent experimenting and related costs."

// CHANGE: Updated all messaging to focus on AI experimentation instead of traditional R&D
// INTEGRATION: Calculator component will showcase AI-specific examples
// TODO: Add testimonials from real AI-using businesses
// TODO: Implement A/B testing for "AI Credits" vs "Tax Savings" messaging
// BUG FIX: Ensure purple color contrast meets accessibility standards

// Business logic: Federal credits only (no state complexity)
// Pricing is flat-fee based on credit size, not percentage
// All examples feature businesses using ChatGPT, Claude, custom GPTs
// Messaging avoids technical jargon - uses "experiments" not "development"
```

Include inline comments for:
- AI-specific examples and use cases
- Non-technical language requirements
- Federal-only calculations
- Accessibility considerations
- Places where "no coding required" messaging appears

The component should feel approachable and friendly to non-technical business owners while maintaining professionalism and trust."
