Here's a comprehensive agent prompt to fix your crashed app:

```
Fix the React app crash after implementing the design system. The app is located in the client/ folder.

Context:
- Just added a global design system with ThemeProvider, global-styles.css, and tailwind.config.js
- App was working before these changes
- File structure: client/src/ contains the React app
- Main file is client/src/App.tsx

Steps to debug and fix:

1. Check the browser console and terminal for specific error messages

2. Verify file locations:
   - client/src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx should exist
   - client/src/styles/global-styles.css should exist
   - client/tailwind.config.js should exist

3. Check App.tsx imports are correct:
   ```tsx
   import './styles/global-styles.css';
   import { ThemeProvider } from './providers/ThemeProvider';
   ```

4. Common fixes to try:

   a) If "module not found" errors:
      - Ensure file paths are correct
      - Check if files actually exist in specified locations
      - Fix any typos in import statements

   b) If ThemeProvider errors:
      - Make sure ThemeProvider wraps the entire app
      - Check if React is imported in ThemeProvider.tsx
      - Verify createContext is imported from 'react'

   c) If CSS/Tailwind errors:
      - Ensure index.css has Tailwind directives at the top:
        ```css
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```
      - Check if @import './styles/global-styles.css'; is after Tailwind directives

   d) If tailwind.config.js errors:
      - Verify the content paths are correct:
        ```js
        content: [
          "./index.html",
          "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
        ],
        ```

5. Quick recovery if needed:
   - Comment out the new imports in App.tsx
   - Remove ThemeProvider wrapper temporarily
   - Get app running again, then add features one by one

6. Test minimal implementation:
   - First just import global-styles.css
   - Then add ThemeProvider
   - Finally test design system components

Please fix the crash, identify the root cause, and ensure the design system is properly integrated. Share the specific error message and the fix applied.
```

This prompt should help an AI agent or developer quickly identify and fix the crash. The key is to work incrementally - get the app running first, then add the design system features one by one.
