// INTEGRATION: Calculator component will be imported and embedded in section 6
// TODO: Connect interactive calculator component once built
// TODO: Implement Google Analytics event tracking for CTAs
// TODO: Add A/B testing framework for headline variations

// Business logic: Pricing tiers correspond to federal credit amounts
// Tier assignment happens dynamically in the calculator component
// All copy follows IRS-compliant messaging guidelines
```

Include inline comments for:
- Conversion optimization points
- Mobile-specific considerations  
- Integration points with other components
- Copy that may need A/B testing
- Placeholder content that needs real assets

The component should be production-ready with proper error boundaries, loading states, and accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, proper heading hierarchy)."
